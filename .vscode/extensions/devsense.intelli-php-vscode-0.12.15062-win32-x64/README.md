## Features

- **AI Code Predictions:** IntelliPHP leverages artificial intelligence to provide intelligent code predictions. As you type, the extension suggests relevant code completions and shows them as grey text in your editor. This feature helps you write code faster and reduces the time spent on manual typing.

- **Snippets:** IntelliPHP intelligently identifies parts of the suggestion that require developer input and places the cursor there. You can then easily fill in the necessary details. Pressing TAB will navigate to the next input location within the suggestion, helping you efficiently complete the snippet. If there are no more input locations, pressing TAB will take you to the end of the suggestion, allowing you to continue your coding seamlessly.

- **Pre-selecting the Item in the Completion List:** When you are using IntelliPHP with the [PHP Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode), you will get intelligent pre-selection of the most probable item in the completion list.

- **Offline Mode:** IntelliPHP operates locally on your machine, which means it doesn't require an Internet connection. Your code and typing activity remains private, and no data is sent outside your computer. Enjoy the benefits of AI-assisted development without sacrificing your privacy.

- **No API Keys:** Unlike some AI-powered tools, IntelliPHP doesn't require any API keys or external services to function. It works seamlessly within your Visual Studio Code environment, simplifying the setup process and eliminating the need for additional configuration steps.

## Supported Platforms

IntelliPHP supports ARM and x64 versions of Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems. Regardless of your preferred platform, you can take advantage of IntelliPHP's AI capabilities to boost your PHP development workflow.
